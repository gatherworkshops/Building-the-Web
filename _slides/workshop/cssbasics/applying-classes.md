notes: |
  We can apply a CSS class to any HTML element. We can also apply the *same* class to *many* different elements on the page.

  The class name you gave your element in the HTML and the class name you use in your CSS need to match exactly. 

  There is no dot before the class name in our HTML but we _do_ need that dot in our CSS code.

## Applying Classes

Find the first image tag in the HTML panel,<br> and apply the profile-pic class to it.

**Find this line your HTML panel:**

    <img src="http://gathergather.co.nz/grumpy-cat.png">

**And change it to:**

    <img class="profile-pic" src="http://gathergather.co.nz/grumpy-cat.png">

Cartoon Grumpy Cat should now be much smaller.
