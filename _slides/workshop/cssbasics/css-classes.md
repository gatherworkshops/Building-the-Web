  We use CSS to write code about how objects on our page should look.

  This code says that any HTML element with the class `profile-pic` should be displayed as 200 pixels wide.

  One little trick - don't forget the dot in front of the class name in CSS!

## Classes

To make our page look pretty, first we create a CSS class with a unique name.

**In your CSS panel:**
    
    .profile-pic {
      width: 200px;
    }

We just created a `class` called `profile-pic`.

This class can change the width of something on our page to be `200px`.
