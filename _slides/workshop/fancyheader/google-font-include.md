title: google-font-include
section: fancyheader
layout: slide
class: default-slide

notes: |
  The piece of code we add to our site's `head` is just a link to some special CSS on Google's web server.

  Google is providing us a CSS stylesheet that we can link to so that we don't have to write a whole lot of extra code ourselves to correctly embed the font in our site.

## Adding the font to your site

On the "Quick Use" page, look for step 3.

![Finding the Google Font embed code](/Building-the-Web/slides/workshop/images/google-font-include.png)

Copy that piece of HTML code<br> 
and put it between your site's `<head>` tags.

It should go on the line before the link to your own stylesheet.
