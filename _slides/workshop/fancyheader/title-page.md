  Every website needs a great logo and a pretty header.

  A site's header usually contains a logo and its navigation. For your web page, you can choose to have just a logo, or you can add some navigation too. It's up to you! We'll look at both options.
  
  Have a think about the theme of your site and what its header might look like.
