  The `header` element has no styles already associated with it.

  It is pretty much just a see-through box which you can use to contain anything you want.

  Using a `header` allows us to group together all the elements which are part of the header, for easy styling using CSS.

## Page Header

We can use the `header` element as a container for our title and navigation.

Start by adding the header HTML with a title:

    <header class="page-header">
        <h1>My Awesome Website</h1>
    </header>
