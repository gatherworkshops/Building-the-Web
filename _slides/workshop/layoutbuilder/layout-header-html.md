  The `header` element has no styles already associated with it.

  It is pretty much just a see-through box which you can use to contain anything you want.

  Using a header allows us to group together all the elements which are part of the header, for easy styling using CSS.

  Add a header to the `body` of your `index.html` page.

  You should change the heading text to suit your site!

## Header Content

Add to `index.html`, between the `body` tags:

    <header class="page-header">
        <h1>My Awesome Website</h1>
    </header>

You should now see a heading on your page.<br>
The header box will be invisible until you add CSS.
