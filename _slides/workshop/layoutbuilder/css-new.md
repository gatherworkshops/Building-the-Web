notes: |

  In your dashboard, click "Create File" and call it `style.css`.

  The `style.css` file is where you put all of the CSS code for your whole website. All of your website's pages share a single CSS file.

  When you add more pages you don't need to add any more CSS files. The same design rules should apply to all pages in your website, so they can be shared.
