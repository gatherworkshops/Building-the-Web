notes: |

  In your dashboard, click "Create File" and call it `index.html`.

  The `index` page is where you put all of the HTML code for your website's home page.

  Your home page needs to be called `index.html` so that your web browser can load it automatically.

  When you add more pages, you can call the extra ones whatever you like, but your home page should always be called `index.html`!
