notes: |
  The `index` page is where you put all of the HTML code that makes up what your website's home page should look like.

  Your home page needs to be called `index.html` so that your web browser can load it automatically.

  When you add more pages, you can call the extra ones whatever you like, but your home page should always be called `index.html`!

## Index Page

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

        <!-- head only used by the browser -->
        <head>
            <title>My Page Title</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        </head>

        <!-- body contains the visible page content -->
        <body>
            <!-- My HTML Code Goes Here-->
        </body>
    
    </html>

_This is the HTML code for your home page_
