title: layout-content
section: layoutbuilder
layout: slide
class: centered-slide

notes: |
  Our second layout element will be a content section.

  You'll notice that we skipped the menu bar - don't worry! We'll come back to that in the next chapter.

  Our content section will go below the header, and it will contain all the text and images we want on the page.

  The content section element will be a plain box. We will also add in some simple paragraphs and images to test that it looks good with content in it.
