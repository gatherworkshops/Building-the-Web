## Content Section Style

So our text is on the page but it's just floating.

Let's give the section some design, using its name:

    .page-content {
        background-color: #222222;
        padding: 30px;
        width: 700px;
        margin: 0 auto;
        margin-top: 30px;

        color: #FFFFFF;
        font-size: 14px;
        line-height: 130%;
    }
