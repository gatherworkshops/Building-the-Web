notes: |

  Further down your `index.html` you will find the body tags.

  Everything we want to be visible on our page will go between these two tags.

  All HTML code you add to your page should go _after_ the opening body tag and _before_ the closing body tag.

  There are some special cases, but if they come up the instructions will make it very clear.

## HTML Body

    <!-- body contains the visible page content -->
    <body>
        <!-- My HTML Code Goes Here-->
    </body>

All of the **HTML** code we add today will be<br>
between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags.
