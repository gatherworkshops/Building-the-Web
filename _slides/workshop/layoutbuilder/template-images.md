  Any images you use in your site should be uploaded to the images folder.
  
  There are some sample images already in the folder, but you can delete them or add more, it's up to you!

  If you find an image online that you'd like to use, you will need to download it, give it a sensible name, and then upload it to your images folder in CloudCannon.

  Your image file names need to be all lowercase letters.

  No spaces!
