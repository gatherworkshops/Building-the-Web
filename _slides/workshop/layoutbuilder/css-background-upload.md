  Upload your background image to Cloud Cannon.

  To use an image in our website, it's best if we upload as part of the project.

  If we just link to the image somewhere else on the Internet, there is no guarantee that the owner of the image won't delete it, move it or rename it, which would stop it from showing up on our own website.
