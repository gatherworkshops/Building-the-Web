notes: |

  All images in our website should be stored in an `images` folder.

  CloudCannon has a design flaw where you can't create an empty folder.

  To get around this, click on your background image's options and choose "Move to new folder".

  Call the new folder "images" - CloudCannon will create the folder and move your background image inside it.
