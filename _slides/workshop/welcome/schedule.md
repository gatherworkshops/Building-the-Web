  Today's workshop is arranged in six different sections.

  In the first part we will look at how the Internet works and what this means for us as coders, plus take a look at the basics of web code languages. 

  After that we will start working on our own websites, so think about a topic! We'll design a page layout and a menu bar.

  Later we will add some fancy extras to our site, like YouTube videos and a gallery.
