  Hey, a new type of HTML element! 

  The `nav` element is used for creating navigation. It has matching start and end tags, and between those tags you put a set of links that you want to include in your navigation.

  We'll get to that on the next slide!

  If you preview your navigation right now, it won't look like anything - it doesn't have any styles yet! 

  We did set up the class `main-menu` though, so we'll be able to style this nav from our CSS.

## Navigation HTML

Add the `nav` on the line after your closing `</header>` tag:

    <nav class="main-menu">

    </nav>

_Create the layout container for your menu bar_
