title: navigation-css
section: menubar
layout: slide
class: centered-slide

notes: |
  Our nav has the class `main-menu` so we can use this in our CSS to add some design to our nav.

  Keep in mind that we are currently just styling the `nav` element, which is a container for all our navigation links.

  We'll get to styling the links soon, and make them look a bit more like buttons.

## Navigation Styles

In your CSS, create a new rule:

    .main-menu {
        background: #FF0000;
    }

_Add a background to your nav, so you can see it_
