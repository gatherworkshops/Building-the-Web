layout: slide
class: centered-slide

notes: |
  Each link is just an `a` element, like we tried out earlier.

  Remember that links always need their `href` set to a web address where we want the link to go. 

  The _Home_ link will go back to our `index.html`, so we can fill that in.

  We haven't created a `pictures.html` or a `videos.html` yet, but we can fill in the link and then create the page later.

  If you preview your page now, it won't look like much but the links should at least be showing up! We'll give them some style next.

## Navigation Links

Add your page links, between the `nav` tags:

    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
    <a href="pictures.html">Pictures</a>
    <a href="videos.html">Videos</a>

_Add some links to your menu bar_
