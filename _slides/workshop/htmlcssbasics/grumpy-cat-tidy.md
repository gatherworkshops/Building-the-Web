## Element Selectors

Now all that we have to do is tidy up our colours. We need to remove the backgrounds we used for planning our layout.

**In your CSS:**

- Find `.page-header` and remove the background
- Find `.info-section` and change background to white
- Find `.gallery-section` and remove the background
