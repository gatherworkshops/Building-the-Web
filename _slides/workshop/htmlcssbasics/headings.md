  Let's start with some really common HTML elements.

  The first line is how we make large heading text, using the `h1` element. That's a "one" after the "h" by the way!
  
  See how the start and end of the element are written the same, except for the  extra "slash" at the end? That's a really common format in HTML.

## Headings

Add `<h1>` and `</h1>` tags to make the `Alpacas` heading big and bold.


    <h1>Alpacas</h1>

`<h1>` says "start the heading here"

`</h1>` says "end the heading here"
