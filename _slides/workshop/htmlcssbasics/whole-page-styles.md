## Whole Page Styles

When we have styles we want to apply to the whole page, we can target the `body`, because all other tags are between the `body` tags.

**At the top of your CSS, on a new line:**

    body {
      background-color: gold;
      background-image: url(http://subtlepatterns.com/patterns/food.png);
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }

Your background should now be yellow with a pattern.
