notes: |
  Image tags work a little differently. Look closely, where is the closing tag?

  The image tag only has an opening tag! There is no matching closing tag.

  The example here is simplified so that you can see how it works. To get an image to show up, you will need to delete the hashtag `#` and replace it with the URL of an image.

  The next page has a full example for you.

## Image Tags

Add an `img` tag to the very bottom of your code:

    <img src="#" height="100">

**`src` stands for "source"**<br>
Replace the `#` with a link to an image online.

**`height` is the height of the image**<br>
This is optional, it is the height in pixels.
