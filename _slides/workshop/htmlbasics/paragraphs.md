  Paragraphs of text use the `p` element.

  A paragraph of text will automatically have some space before and after it.

## Paragraphs

Now use `<p>` tags to split up your paragraphs.

    <p>
    An alpaca is a domesticated species of 
    South American camelid. It resembles a 
    small llama in appearance.
    </p>

Put a `<p>` *before* each paragraph,<br> 
and a `</p>` *after* each paragraph.
