  To get your image working, you will need to replace the hashtag `#` with an image URL.

  Find an image you want to use online. Right click it, and choose "Copy image URL". You can then paste the URL into your code.

  If your image doesn't work, try another. Linking to some images is blocked by the sites who own them.
