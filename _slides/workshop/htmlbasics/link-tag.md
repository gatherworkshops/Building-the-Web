  Links help us connect our website to the rest of the World Wide Web.

  The `a` element stands for "anchor" but you can think of it as meaning "action" if that's easier to remember. Clicking a link takes you to another web page.

## Links

Find the word `Wikipedia` in your code.

Turn it into a link using `a` tags, like this:

    <a>Wikipedia</a>

Then add the `href` attribute to the opening tag.

    <a href="#">Wikipedia</a>

This turns the link blue, but we need another step to make it clickable.
