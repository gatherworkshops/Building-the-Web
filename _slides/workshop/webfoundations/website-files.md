  Every web site that we visit is made up of all these files.

  There are HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files and also files in lots of other languages.

  Other programming languages are used for making more complex websites, with user accounts you can log in to, or shopping sites where you can buy things.

## HTML + CSS + JS = Website!
