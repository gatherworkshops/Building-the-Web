  Maybe it would be easier to describe the Internet in smaller pieces. Have a go at answering these questions:

  - What do we use the Internet for?

  - How do we access the Internet?

  - Who pays for the Internet, and who gets paid?

  See if you can come up with at least one answer for each of the questions above.
