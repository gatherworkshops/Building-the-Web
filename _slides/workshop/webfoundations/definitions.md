  The Internet is what we use to access the World Wide Web.

  The World Wide Web is the content that we consume.

  When we create a website on the World Wide Web, we are contributing to the set of _interlinked documents_.

  When we access the Internet, we are making use of a worldwide network of _interlinked computers_.

  Can you identify which of your Internet-related words from earlier apply to the Internet, and which ones really apply to the World Wide Web?
