  Telephone numbers, IP addresses and street addresses are all unique locations across the whole planet.
  
  If one person's telephone stops working, or one city's phone system stops working, or even a whole country, phones will continue to work.

  The Internet is the same. It is _decentralised_ which means that it has no central control room and it can still function as a whole if some parts stop working.

## Kinda like telephones!

The Internet can be compared to the telephone system:

- Nobody owns the whole thing
- Companies do control individual parts
- Telephone numbers and IP addresses are unique
- There is no central control room
