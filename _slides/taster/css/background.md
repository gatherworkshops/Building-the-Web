title: background
section: css
layout: slide
class: default-slide

notes: |

  We already have an 'html' tag on the page, so we can style it from the CSS using the keyword 'html'.

  We use this one for adding a background as it is the outermost element - it contains everything else on the page so we know the bg will go behind everything else.

  To add your own image, you will need to choose one, download it, then upload it to your Neocities dashboard.

## Background

Let's start by adding a background image to your site.

    html {
        background-color: black;
        background-image: url('http://tiny.cc/swirls');
    }
