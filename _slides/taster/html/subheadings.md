title: subheadings
section: html
layout: slide
class: default-slide

notes: |
  Just like we used `h1` for the most important title on the page, we can use `h2` for headings which are second most important.

  The start and end of the element are still written the same, with the extra "slash" in the closing tag.

## Subheadings

Now use `<h2>` tags to make `Alpaca Hair` and `Habitat` big.

    <h2>Alpaca Hair</h2>

`h1` is the biggest heading<br>
`h2` is the second biggest heading<br>
`h3` is the third biggest heading

`h6` is the smallest heading
