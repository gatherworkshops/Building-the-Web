notes: |
  Our sample styles show how you can add a background colour to your header, change the text colour, and get the stuff inside the header to be pushed away from the edges a bit.

  You don't have to have a background colour on your header - if you want to get rid of it, just delete that line completely!

## Header Design

Add to your `style.css`:

    .page-header {
        background-color: #222222;
        color: #FFFFFF;
        padding: 20px;
    }

This code will give your header a dark grey background,<br>
white text and 20px of spacing around the inside edge.
