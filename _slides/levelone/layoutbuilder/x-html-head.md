notes: |

  The `head` section of a web page contains information about your page. It _doesn't_ contain anything which is actually visible on the page.

  Be careful, `head` and `header` are two very different tags!

  The `title` is what shows up in your browser tab.

  The `link` is to the stylesheet which will contain our CSS code.

  You won't be able to see your title in CloudCannon.

## HTML Head

    <head>
        <title>My Page Title</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>

_The head contains a browser tab **title** and a CSS file **link**_
