			<h3>Not A Series Of Tubes</h3>
			<p>
			Despite popular belief, the Internet is not a series of tubes or your web browser. We'll take you on the dime tour of the web, dispelling myths about tubes and Second Life-like virtual realities. We'll also show you that a website is just a collection of files connected to a domain name that link to each other.

			<h3>There and Back Again: How does the Internet work?</h3>
			<p>
				The video lets you ride shotgun with a packet of data—one of trillions involved in the trillions of Internet interactions that happen every second. Look deep beneath the surface of the most basic Internet transaction, and follow the packet as it flows from your fingertips, through circuits, wires, and cables, to a host server, and then back again, all in less than a second.
