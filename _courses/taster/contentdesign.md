      Welcome to our web development taster!

      This workshop is designed to introduce you to the basics of writing websites using code.

      By the end of the workshop you will have coded and published a one-page
      website on a topic of your choice.

      Your mentors are super friendly, make sure to say hi.

      They actually get paid to do this stuff for a job, which is super cool.

      You can ask them for help with your code, ask them about their day job, or ask them what their favourite colour is.

      They're here to help, so ask them anything :)
