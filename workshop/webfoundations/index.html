		<p>
		Despite popular belief, the Internet is not a series of tubes or your web browser. We'll show you that a website is just a collection of files connected to a domain name that link to each other.

		<h2 class="title">Who invented the Internet, and why?</h2>
		<p>
		Nuclear war, cat gifs and reddit?  Wait, what? Who was the genius who came up with all of that?

		<h2 class="title">There and Back Again: How does the Internet work?</h2>
		
		<p>
		This video lets you ride shotgun with a packet of data—one of trillions involved in the trillions of Internet interactions that happen every second. Look deep beneath the surface of the most basic Internet transaction, and follow the packet as it flows from your fingertips, through circuits, wires, and cables, to a host server, and then back again, all in less than a second.
